== README

This is my first rails app, which I created as my final project for General Assembly Boston's Back End Web Development class in Fall of 2013. The app is marketplace for used furniture, similar to Craigslist, except with user accounts, Instagram integration and a better UI. 

This app uses rails 4 and Bootstrap 2
